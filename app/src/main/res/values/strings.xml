    <string name="how_to_play">This is the instruction on how to play the tic-tac-toe game.
        \n1. The game is played on a grid that\'s 3 squares by 3 squares.
        \n2. You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
        \n3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
        \n4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
        \n\nTop-Left	Top-Center	Top-Right\n
Middle-Left	Middle-Center	Middle-Right\n
Bottom-Left	Bottom-Center	Bottom-Right</string>

        \n
        To beat the Opponent (or at least tie), you need to make use of a little bit of strategy. \nStrategy means figuring out what you need to do to win.
        Part of your strategy is trying to figure out how to get three Xs in a row. \nThe other part is trying to figure out how to stop the Opponent from getting three Os in a row.
        \n\nAfter you put an X in a square, you start looking ahead. Where\'s the best place for your next X? You look at the empty squares and decide which ones are good choicesâ€”which ones might let you make three Xs in a row.\n\n
        You also have to watch where the Opponent puts its O. That could change what you do next. If the Opponent gets two Os in a row, you have to put your next X in the last empty square in that row, or the Opponent will win. \n\nYou are forced to play in a particular square or lose the game.
        If you always pay attention and look ahead, you\'ll never lose a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. You may not win, but at least you\'ll tie.</string>
